## Intro
Yes, I know, the blockchain hype is over. But still, I think distributed apps and smart contracts are worth a deeper look. Life is more interesting if you can learn new stuff and try it out yourself.

This is an overview of the files I am adding to the documentation as I go. 

Maybe it grows as this project grows.
